The ascomycete pathogen *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* is a necrotrophic pathogen on over 400 known host plants, and is the causal agent of white mold on dry bean. 
<!-- Two to three sentences of more detailed background, comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines.  -->
Currently, there are no known cultivars of dry bean with complete resistance to white mold. 
For more than 20 years, bean breeders have been using white mold screening nurseries with natural populations of *S. sclerotiorum* to screen new cultivars for resistance. 
It is thus important to know if the genetic diversity in populations of *S. sclerotiorum* within these nurseries a) reflect the genetic diversity of the populations in the surrounding region and b) are stable over time. 
Previous studies have used mycelial compatibility groups (MCG) as a proxy for clonal lineages to study genetic diversity.
<!-- One sentence clearly stating the general problem being addressed by this particular study. -->
<!-- One sentence summarising the main result (with the words "here we show" or their equivalent). Two or three sentences explaining what the main result reveals in direct comparison to what was thought to be the case previously, or how the main result adds to previous knowledge. -->
We genotyped 366 isolates of *S. sclerotiorum* from 2003--2012 representing 11 states, Mexico, France, and Australia at 11 microsatellite loci showing that populations were loosely structured over space and time, but not by cultivar, aggressiveness, or field source with genotypes shared between many regions, except for Mexico. 
Moreover, we find no evidence that the conventional assay for mycelial compatibility groups represent clonal lineages.

One or two sentences to put the results into a more general context. Two or three sentences to provide a broader perspective, readily comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline, may be included in the first paragraph if the editor considers that the accessibility of the paper is significantly enhanced by their inclusion. Under these circumstances, the length of the paragraph can be up to 300 words. (The above example is 190 words without the final section, and 250 words with it). -->
Our study suggests that breeders should continue to test dry bean lines in several white mold screening nurseries across the US to account for both the phenotypic and genotypic variation that exists across regions.
