The ascomycete pathogen *Sclerotinia sclerotiorum* is a necrotrophic pathogen on over 400 known host plants, and is the causal agent of white mold on dry bean. 
<!-- Two to three sentences of more detailed background, comprehensible to scientists in related disciplines.  -->
Currently, there are no known cultivars of dry bean with complete resistance to white mold. 
For more than 20 years, bean breeders have been using white mold screening nurseries with natural populations of *S. sclerotiorum* to screen new cultivars for resistance. 
It is thus important to know if the genetic diversity in populations of *S. sclerotiorum* within these nurseries a) reflect the genetic diversity of the populations in the surrounding region and b) are stable over time. 
Furthermore, previous studies have investigated the correlation between mycelial compatibility groups (MCG) and multilocus haplotypes (MLH), but none have formally tested these patterns.

<!-- One sentence summarising the main result (with the words "here we show" or their equivalent). Two or three sentences explaining what the main result reveals in direct comparison to what was thought to be the case previously, or how the main result adds to previous knowledge. -->
We genotyped 366 isolates of *S. sclerotiorum* from producer fields and white mold screening nurseries surveyed over 10 years in 2003--2012 representing 11 states, Mexico, France, and Australia at 11 microsatellite loci resulting in 165 MLHs. 
Populations were loosely structured over space and time based on analysis of molecular variance and discriminant analysis of principal components, but not by cultivar, aggressiveness, or field source.
Of all the regions tested, only Mexico (n=18) shared no MLHs with any other region. 
Using a bipartite network-based approach, we found no evidence that the MCGs accurately represent MLHs.

One or two sentences to put the results into a more general context. Two or three sentences to provide a broader perspective, readily comprehensible to a scientist in any discipline, may be included in the first paragraph if the editor considers that the accessibility of the paper is significantly enhanced by their inclusion. Under these circumstances, the length of the paragraph can be up to 300 words. (The above example is 190 words without the final section, and 250 words with it). -->
Our study suggests that breeders should continue to test dry bean lines in several white mold screening nurseries across the US to account for both the phenotypic and genotypic variation that exists across regions.
